# Spring Boot CRUD Application with Redis Caching and JUnit 5 Testing

This repository contains a Spring Boot application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with integrated Redis caching to optimize performance. The application is thoroughly tested using JUnit 5 to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented using Spring Data JPA for seamless database interactions.
- **Redis Caching**: Utilizes Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
- **JUnit 5**: Comprehensive unit tests using JUnit 5 to validate application functionality and ensure code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Provides the foundation for building and running the application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Facilitates interaction with the database.
- **Redis**: Used as an in-memory data store for caching.
- **JUnit 5**: Framework for writing and running unit tests.
